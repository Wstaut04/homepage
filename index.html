 <h1> Will Stautberg </h1>


<p> Hi my name is Will Stautberg. I was born and raised in Cincinnati Ohio. I am 21 years old and a my second year at UC and some crazy things about me is that lived in yellowstone National park and took a gap year so let me tell you about that. <p/>






<h2> Yellowstone National Park </h2>

<p> I graduated from Moeller and 8 days after that I hopped on a plane by myself and went to work in the kichen. In yellowstone I lived in a cabin for my first summer and my second summer I lived in a dorm style building. I was one of the only people from cincinnati my age that did this. I met so many people from across the world. Out west the mountians and sunsets are amazing I learned how to cook and live on my own.</p>
